## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

The main problem is that if there is snow on the ground, the airport can not send
and receive flights.
#### **Minor issues:**

is no tool to ensure fast and efficient snow removal at the
airport.

- There is no visualization of the snow removal process and the current status.

- There is a need for a convenient tool for assigning tasks and monitoring their
execution.

- There is a need to calculate and assign the necessary resources for
snow removal, depending on the weather situation

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Our solution is based on simplifying job creation and worker management.


## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

We want to improve the UI, refractor code.
Make the dispatcher work more autonomously based on the flights of planes and the paths of people.
Ability to track the state of snow by cameras
